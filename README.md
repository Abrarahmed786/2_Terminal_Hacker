# Complete Unity Developer 2.0 - Section 2 - Terminal Hacker.

This is the long-awaited sequel to the Complete Unity Developer - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects, our latest teaching techniques.

You will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 293,000 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo.

## In This Section
C# functions, refactoring, enumerations, basic state machines. Arguments, parameters, strings, conditionals, variables. Whitespace management, bug fixes and basic game design. (Ref: TH_CU2)
